To ensure the smooth processing of your visa application and subsequent renewals, and to safeguard your legal rights in Portugal, we hereby issue this formal reminder to review and settle the following fees in a timely manner. These payments are directly linked to the validity of your residence status and the stability of your investments in Portugal. Please refer to the attached document for the full invoice details:

1	税务代表费（Tax Representative Fee）
	根据葡萄牙法律，黄金签证持有者需指定税务代表以履行税务义务。税务代表将协助处理相关申报事务，确保您的税务合规，避免因违规或延误影响签证续签。
	Tax Representative Fee
	Under Portuguese law, Golden Visa holders must appoint a tax representative to fulfill their tax obligations. The representative assists in tax filings and ensures your compliance, avoiding penalties or risks that may affect your residence renewal.

2	IMI房产持有税（适用于房产持有投资人）
	IMI 是房产持有者每年必须缴纳的市政税，按房产所在地区征收。如未按期缴纳，可能导致罚金、信用受损，甚至影响居留资格。
	IMI Property Tax (Applicable to property holders)
	IMI is an annual municipal property tax levied on real estate holders in Portugal. Delayed payment may result in penalties, damage to your credit record, and impact your residence status.

3 	个人收入税（IRS）（如适用，通常在7-8月收到官方通知）
	如您在葡萄牙有收入来源（如租金或工资），需依法申报和缴纳IRS。按时申报是维护良好税务记录的必要条件。
	Personal Income Tax (IRS) (If applicable – usually notified in July/August)
	If you have any income in Portugal, such as rental or employment income, it is mandatory to declare and pay IRS in accordance with Portuguese tax law. Timely compliance helps maintain a clean tax record and avoid legal risks.

4	 物业保险费（QBE团购保险）（适用于房产持有投资人）
	为保障您的房产，公司组织团购QBE保险，覆盖火灾、地震等主要风险。请务必确保保险持续有效，避免在发生意外时处于无保障状态。
	Property Insurance Premium (QBE Group Insurance) (Applicable to property holders)
	To safeguard your real estate, our company offers a group insurance plan through QBE at competitive rates. This policy covers key risks such as fire, earthquake, and natural disasters. Please ensure continuous coverage to protect your property and avoid 	uncovered losses.

5	 物业管理费（Condo Fee）（适用于房产持有投资人）
	用于房产所在小区的公共维护与管理，属于业主的共同责任。请根据物业公司通知及时缴纳，以免产生不必要的法律或邻里纠纷。
	Condominium Fee (Condo Fee) (Applicable to property holders)
	This fee is used to maintain and manage common areas of your property community. Timely payment is a shared responsibility and helps avoid legal disputes or disruption of services.
