邮件正文：
尊敬的{cus_name}：
Dear {cus_name},

您好！
Greetings！

感谢您选择我司作为您葡萄牙黄金签证申请及后续服务的合作伙伴。为确保您的签证申请及续签流程顺利进行，并保障您在葡萄牙的合法权益，我司此前已向您发送关于相关费用缴纳的正式通知。但截至目前，我们尚未收到您的付款记录。为避免影响您的签证有效性及在葡投资的稳定性，我司再次郑重提醒您，请务必关注并按时缴纳以下费用。详细账单信息请参见附件:
Thank you for selecting our company as your trusted partner in managing your Portugal Golden Visa application and ongoing support services. To ensure the smooth processing of your visa application and renewals, and to safeguard your legal rights in Portugal, we previously issued a formal notice regarding the required fee payments. However, as of today, we have not received confirmation of your payment. In order to avoid any risk to your residence status and the stability of your investments in Portugal, we hereby issue this urgent reminder to review and settle the following fees promptly. Please refer to the attached document for full invoice details.

📌 重点费用说明| Key Fees:

1	税务代表费（Tax Representative Fee）
	根据葡萄牙法律，黄金签证持有者需指定税务代表以履行税务义务。税务代表将协助处理相关申报事务，确保您的税务合规，避免因违规或延误影响签证续签。
	Tax Representative Fee
	Under Portuguese law, Golden Visa holders must appoint a tax representative to fulfill their tax obligations. The representative assists in tax filings and ensures your compliance, avoiding penalties or risks that may affect your residence renewal.

2	IMI房产持有税（适用于房产持有投资人）
	特此提醒，根据葡萄牙税务记录其2025年度IMI（Municipal Property Tax）税款未能于法定最终缴纳期限（2025年6月30日）前完成支付。根据葡萄牙税法规定，逾期未缴税款将自动进入宽限期（Grace Period），本次补缴截止日期为 2025年7月31日。若未能在该日期前完成付款，税务局将按日加收滞纳金以及啓动可能相关的法律程序，建议尽快支付。IMI 是房产持有者每年必须缴纳的市政税，按房产所在地区征收。如未按期缴纳，可能导致罚金、信用受损，甚至影响居留资格。
	This is to remind you that, according to the Portuguese tax records, the 2025 IMI (Municipal Property Tax) for your property was not paid by the statutory final deadline of June 30, 2025. In accordance with Portuguese tax law, unpaid taxes automatically enter a grace period, with the new payment deadline set for July 31, 2025. Failure to pay by this date will result in daily interest charges and may trigger relevant legal procedures. We recommend settling the payment as soon as possible. IMI Property Tax is an annual municipal property tax levied on real estate holders in Portugal. Delayed payment may result in penalties, damage to your credit record, and impact your residence status.

    ⏰ 温馨提醒：此次提醒之2025年 IMI 缴费稅局截止日为 7月31日，请务必在此之前完成缴纳。
    Reminder: The 2025 IMI tax deadline is July 31 – please ensure payment before this date.

3 	个人收入税（IRS）（如适用，通常在7-8月收到官方通知）
	如您在葡萄牙有收入来源（如租金或工资），需依法申报和缴纳IRS。按时申报是维护良好税务记录的必要条件。
	Personal Income Tax (IRS) (If applicable – usually notified in July/August)
	If you have any income in Portugal, such as rental or employment income, it is mandatory to declare and pay IRS in accordance with Portuguese tax law. Timely compliance helps maintain a clean tax record and avoid legal risks.

4	 物业保险费（QBE团购保险）（适用于房产持有投资人）
	为保障您的房产，公司组织团购QBE保险，覆盖火灾、地震等主要风险。请务必确保保险持续有效，避免在发生意外时处于无保障状态。
	Property Insurance Premium (QBE Group Insurance) (Applicable to property holders)
	To safeguard your real estate, our company offers a group insurance plan through QBE at competitive rates. This policy covers key risks such as fire, earthquake, and natural disasters. Please ensure continuous coverage to protect your property and avoid 	uncovered losses.

5	 物业管理费（Condo Fee）（适用于房产持有投资人）
	用于房产所在小区的公共维护与管理，属于业主的共同责任。请根据物业公司通知及时缴纳，以免产生不必要的法律或邻里纠纷。
	Condominium Fee (Condo Fee) (Applicable to property holders)
	This fee is used to maintain and manage common areas of your property community. Timely payment is a shared responsibility and helps avoid legal disputes or disruption of services.
